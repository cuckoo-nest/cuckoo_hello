# Cuckoo Hello

This is a simple hello world project to demonstrate

- Cross compiling works and this can be ran on a Nest Thermostat
- Input devices cann be read
- Screen can be controlled
- Backplate can be read from

# Build instruction

## Build

run the following:

```
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
cd ..
```

## Upload

SSH to the Nest and start a simple server to receive the file:

```
nc -l -p 51234 > ./hello
```

On the build host. send the hello exe via netcat:

```
cat ./build/output/hello | nc -w1 NEST_IP_ADDR 51234
```

Back on the nest, alter permissions:

```
chmod +x ./hello
```

## Run

Stop the nest client so we can control hardware:

```
/etc/init.d/nestlabs stop
```

Now you can run with

```
./hello
```

For the backplate, you can do the `cat` / `wc` steps with `/build/output/backplate` instead
